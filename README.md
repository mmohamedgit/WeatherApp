Welcome to my first React project and NodeJS project! This app is mobile friendly and it is built with React for the frontend and Express/NodeJS for the backend.

This application displays the current weather conditions for your local area. You can also search for weather conditions in other cities too.

The weather data is provided by OpenWeatherMap API. You can use your own API key in the server.js file.

Here is the API reference for fetching the weather data: https://openweathermap.org/current

The app is hosted at Vercel: https://weather-app-lake.vercel.app/
